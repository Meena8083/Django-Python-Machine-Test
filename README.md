The project you're working on is a Django Python machine test scenario that involves creating a web application with three main entities:

1. **User**: Represents users registered in the system.
2. **Client**: Represents clients registered in the system.
3. **Project**: Represents projects associated with clients and users.

The project requires you to perform various tasks, including registering clients, fetching client information, editing/deleting client information, adding new projects for a client, assigning users to projects, and retrieving assigned projects for logged-in users.

You're also required to use Django REST framework for building REST APIs, and MySQL or Postgres as the database (SQLite is not allowed). The provided examples show the expected structure and responses for the REST APIs you need to implement.

Overall, the project involves building a Django web application with user authentication, CRUD operations for clients and projects, and API endpoints to manage and retrieve data related to clients, projects, and users.
